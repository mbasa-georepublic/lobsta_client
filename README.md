# LOBSTA Client

LOBSTA is a new kind of task manager that helps you manage all kinds of location-based tasks collaboratively and more efficient.

## Getting Started

LOBSTA Client is build with Flutter. For help getting started with Flutter, view [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

* [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 
* Install Android Studio, start the program and follow the setup wizard
* Check your environment and resolve eventual issues:

```sh

Check available device:

```sh
flutter devices

### Build for Android

Create file name ```android/key.properties``` that contains the reference to keystore:

```
storePassword=<store password>

```

Follow [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#configure-signing-in-gradle) to configure signing in gradle.
